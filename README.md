# Codes-for-Detecting-drift-from-event-streams-of-unpredictable-business-processes
A python implementation of business process drift detection method [Detecting drift from event streams of unpredictable business processes](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46397-1_26)

P.S.
I don't know how to implement G-Test algorithm, so I used Chi-Squared Test instead. The result shows that Chi-Squared Test works well too.
The [original papaer](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46397-1_26) has no interest to me. I just used this algorithm in my graduation thesis and found it's a very solid work, so I posted a python implementation and hope this may help you.
